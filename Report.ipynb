    "\n",
    "This notebook is a project summary report for the first project submission 'Navigation for the Udacity Ud893 Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree (DRLND).  As such it includes a decription of the implementation, learning algorithm(s), hyperparameters, neural net model architectures, reward/episode plots and ideas for future work.\n",

    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal and Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to develop and train an agent to navigate in a large, square world (environment) and collect items - specifically, to collect yellow bananas, while avoiding blue bananas. This environment is similar to the Banana Collector environment on the [Unity ML-Agents GitHub page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector).\n",

    "![Trained Agent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10624937/42135619-d90f2f28-7d12-11e8-8823-82b970a54d7e.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`0`** - move forward.\n",
    "- **`1`** - move backward.\n",
    "- **`2`** - turn left.\n",
    "- **`3`** - turn right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.\n",

    "## Discussion and Ideas for Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the agents provided good results when comparing them to the Benchmark Implementation example of less than 1800 episodes provided in section 6 of the Project Navigation Concepts outline.  Best scores for each of the agents ran from 297 to 600.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different agents were developed in the following order - DQN, Double DQN, dueling DQN, PER-PP and PER-RBP and since each of these should be an improved algorithm advancement to the previous one, better results were expected as each was in turn developed.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  This could possibly be attributed to not putting enough time into tuning the hyperparameters.  This is especially the case for the agents which take on the order of a few hours to train.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible reason for this inconsistency could also be attributed to the specifics of the environment itself.  For example, in the cited published papers for these algorithms, in the sections where learning curves were shown for a multitude of Atari games for different algorithms, the more advanced algorithm did not always show better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the first two future work ideas are to 1) play further with these models, adjusting and tuning the hyper-parameters and  2) try the current implementations with other environments in order to investigate this discrepency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a better way of evaluating overall performance while training an agent would be of value.  Hence including the simple graphing of functions such as loss, etc. could be work idea 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the Dueling DQN and PER agent implementations, they used the Double DQN as the base algorithm.  Work idea 4) could therefore be to try these advanced agents with the standard DQN agent as the base algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be interesting to change the neural net node sizes and evaluate the effects on overall training performance (work idea 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "The PER agents were developed using a brute force approach and so it would be interesting to investigate and employ techniques that are similar to what was done in the cited papers in order to deal with the performance challenges of sifting through an incredibly large replay memory (work idea 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting thing that was intermittently observed when running a trained agent in the non-training mode (final cell of the `Project 1.ipynb` notebook - `Run Smart Agent` cell) was the agent getting trapped or oscillating between two scenes or states.  An example of these scenarios is one where there was solely only one color of banana in the scene, the scene was somewhat symmetrical about an immaginary central vertical line, and there were bananas to the left and right extremes.  This seemed to put the agent in a position where it had to make a choice between going left or right, however, it chose to continuously move left and right over and over again.  This intuitively makes sense for the case of only blue bananas as turning towards and getting closer to a blue banana would result in it turning away from this banana, only to encounter the same problem with the banana on the other side of the screen, and therefore getting stuck in a loop.  However, this also happens with the yellow bananas.  I assume there is some similar reasoning for this.  There are other scenarios like this that confused the agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that since this type of situation comes up infrequently during training and so there is no learned behaviour available to the agent.  This could potentially be dealt with by forcing the environment to create variations on this scenario during training so that the agent could learn how to deal with this.  Work idea 7 could be to implement this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work idea 8 could be to develop other agents - Noisy DQN, Distributional DQN, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work idea 9 is to implement the learning from pixels challenge.  I planned on including that in this submission, however, I'm eager to get on with the course.\n",
